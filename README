Welcome to VelaTron.

This is a prototype of a possible game. It was written in 2001.

You need SDL developement files to build it. Building is simple.
First create "configure" script from autotools (ignore warnings):

	aclocal
	automake -a
	autoconf

Then:

	./configure
	make

To install it, execute "make install", probably as a super user.
Or just run "src/velatron".

Have fun! :)
